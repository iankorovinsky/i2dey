## Contributing

either fork this repo and open a pr or ask for collab access. no form to submit online since i don't wanna deal with presigned urls, object storage costs, and random people adding notes. also blob storage in a normal db is kind of mid and idk if vercel serves sqlite properly so we go back to the old fashioned way.

refer to `available-notes.ts` to add notes.
